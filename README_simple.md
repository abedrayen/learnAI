# AI Explorer (by Abed Rayen)

## What is it?
AI Explorer is a browser-based 2D learning game where you move through themed levels to learn core AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning ideas by playing short activities.

## How it works
- Each level introduces a concept (AI basics, ML types, first model, neural nets, Teachable Machine, final recap).
- You interact with drag-drop puzzles, quizzes, and visual mini-simulations.
- Progress and achievements are saved locally so you can return later.

## Tech stack
- **TypeScript + Phaser 3**: game logic, scenes, and UI overlays.
- **Vite**: fast build/dev server.
- **Web Audio API**: lightweight procedural sound effects.
- **LocalStorage**: saves level progress and achievements on the device.

## Why it’s different
- Learning-first design: gameplay maps directly to AI/ML concepts.
- Quick links to Colab/Teachable Machine for real hands-on practice.
- Achievements and feedback to keep players engaged.
